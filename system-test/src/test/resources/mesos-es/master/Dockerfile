# Make sure to install OpenJDK 6 explicitly.  The libmesos library includes an
# RPATH entry, which is needed to find libjvm.so at runtime.  This RPATH is
# hard-coded to the OpenJDK version that was present when the package was
# compiled.  So even though the Debian package claims that it works with either
# OpenJDK 6 or OpenJDK 7, the fact that Mesosphere compiled with OpenJDK 6 means
# that we have to have that specific version present at runtime.
